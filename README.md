# 3D Spider Model - Interactive Mouse Rotation

This project presents an **interactive 3D spider model** that rotates dynamically based on mouse movements. Designed to provide a smooth and engaging user experience, it demonstrates the power of modern web technologies like Three.js and WebGL.

## Features

- **Mouse Interaction:** Rotate the spider model by moving your mouse across the screen.
- **Realistic 3D Design:** High-quality spider model with detailed textures and seamless animations.
- **Web-Based Implementation:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for cross-browser compatibility.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Optimized for smooth performance on modern devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js:** For 3D rendering and animation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Core technologies for building the interface and interaction.
- **WebGL:** Enables high-performance 3D graphics in the browser.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and explore the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-WebDev-io/3d-spider-rotation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-spider-rotation
   ```

3. **Install Vite** (optional for running a local development server):
   - Install Vite globally using npm:
     ```bash
